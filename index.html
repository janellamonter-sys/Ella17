        Hello I am Ella Jamaicha Monter. I was born on November 25, 2008. I am 16 years old. I have a simple life, but full of memories. I grew up in a loving and happy family.

        When I was a child, I was very playful. I used to sneak out of the house just to play with our neighbors. We played tagu-taguan, bahay-bahayan, and other fun games. Even when I got scolded, I still played. I really enjoyed my childhood days.

        I still remember my first day in school. I cried a lot because I didnâ€™t want to leave my mother. I was scared and shy. But later, I got used to it. I started to enjoy going to school and meeting new friends. I loved joining contests like MTAP, poem writing, and journalism when I was in elementary. From Kinder to Grade 5, I joined many school activities. I was also an honor student. I tried my best in everything I did.

        From Grade 8 to 10, I stayed on the honor list. I met more friends and enjoyed school more. I learned many lessons in school and in life. I felt that high school was a fun and exciting part of my journey. Now, I am in Grade 11. Senior high school is harder, so I need to be more serious in my studies. I believe this is the start of my training for college. I am learning how to manage my time and be more responsible.
